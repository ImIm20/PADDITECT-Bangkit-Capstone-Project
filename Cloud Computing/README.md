We were able to deploy machine learning model using flask in google compute engine.
We created a simple dashboard on firebase for our user data authentication.
But unfortunately, due to HR circumstances, the team that work on the apps don't have enough time to change the ML deployment model,  so we are still running the ML model in the app.
