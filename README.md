# PADDITECT - Padi Disease Detection

According to the Central Statistics Agency, rice production in 2021 fell 0.43 percent as much as 239.91 thousand tons compared to rice 
production in 2020 which was 54.46 tons GKG. Rice production for food consumption has decreased by 140.73 thousand tons or 0.45 percent 
compared to 2020 production which was 31.50 million tons.

To increase rice production in 2022, innovation is needed, one of which is technology development. With the help of Machine Learning, 
Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development, it is possible to identify diseases and damage to rice caused by pests, which can help farmers 
identify types of pests that attack rice fields instantly and effectively so that farmers can control rice pests well.

This project aims to develop a mobile application to help farmers to identify diseases in paddy. Our aim is to deploy the app to local 
paddy farmers to help them identify the paddy diseases and provide the solution to prevent and/or get rid of the diseases.
